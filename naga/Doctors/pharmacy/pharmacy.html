            <p>
                When you speak to a doctor about your health concerns through an audio/video/ chat, it is known as an online doctor consultation or online medical consultation. This is a good alternative for times when you cannot visit a doctor physically at the clinic
                or hospital. An online doctor consultation works the same way as a physical consultation where you get a prescription after the consultation is complete. Some of the benefits of an online medical consultation at Apollo 24/7 are that you
                can consult a doctor at the convenience of your home and can order the prescribed medicines by using the ‘Order Medicines’ option.
